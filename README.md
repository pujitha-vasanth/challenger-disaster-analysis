# 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster 
## Logistic Regression To Predict Catastrophe
On January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven crew members aboard. The spacecraft disintegrated 46,000 feet (14 km) above the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 11:39 a.m. EST (16:39 UTC). It was the first fatal accident involving an American spacecraft in flight.

Up until January 28th, 1986, a challenger space shuttle was launched 24 times with no catastrophies. A catastrophe can occur in particular when a collective failure of all 5 O-rings occurs. However, 7 out of these 24 launches had experienced 1 O-ring failure-

1 launch had 3 ring failures
1 launch had 2 ring failures
1 launch had 1 ring failure
Collectively there were 10 O-ring failures. But no launch had all 5 rings fail at once, and hence, the catastrophe was eliminated.

On the day of the 25th launch, which had already been postponed a few times due to bad weather and other technical difficulties, the launch site at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, was unusually cold with morning temperature close to 30 degrees F (-1 degree C). Some engineers expressed concerns about the launch in such cold weather given that there was no data to certify a successful launch at those temperatures. It was eventually decided to go ahead with the launch.

Tragically, Challenger experienced a catastrophe where all 5 o-rings failed, leading to the destruction of the shuttle and killing everybody on board. The launch and subsequent disaster was broadcasted live on television across the United States, making headline news.

Could they have prevented this catastrophe? Well, let's try figuring it out. The dataset I will use has 120 data points, 5 for each launch out of 25 launches, which depicts the failure/ no failure for each O-ring.

The Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed analysis of the problem. The dataset is included in csv format.
